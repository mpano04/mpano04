Hello! I'm Maurice Mpano NDABARINZE, a first-year Computer Science student from Rwanda 
with a strong passion for programming and web design.
Currently, I am learning Python programming and honing my skills in web design 
using tools like Figma to create impactful and user-friendly projects.
I'm enthusiastic about collaborating on open-source projects, engaging in web development, 
or participating in initiatives that drive positive change.
Fun fact: I also dabble in cryptocurrency mining and 
enjoy exploring the realm of digital investments.
Feel free to reach out via email at ndabarinzempanomaurice@gmail.com
or connect with me on GitHub at @mpano04.
